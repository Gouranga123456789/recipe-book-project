This is a front-end web application that allows users to create, view, and search for their favorite recipes. All recipes are saved locally in the browser, allowing data to persist even after the page is refreshed.

Features :

  Add Recipes: Users can add new recipes using a form that includes fields for the recipe's name, ingredients, preparation steps, and an image upload.
  View All Recipes: All saved recipes are displayed in a clean, responsive grid layout.
  View Recipe Details: Users can click on any recipe card to open a modal window displaying the full recipe details, including the image, ingredients, and preparation steps.
  Live Search: A search bar allows users to filter recipes in real-time by their name or ingredients. A "No results found" message is displayed if the search yields no matches.
  Data Persistence: Recipes are saved to the browser's localStorage, meaning they will still be there even if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page.
  Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and works cleanly on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
